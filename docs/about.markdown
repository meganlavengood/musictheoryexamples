This is a database of examples to use in the music theory classroom. It was originally hosted on musictheoryexamples.com and compiled by Tim Cutler and Patricia Gray. 

This is an **unofficial** successor to that website. I am affiliated with neither the original project nor with its creators. After hearing from former users who were dismayed the site was no longer available, I scraped the data from [the original website via archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210115151357id_/http://musictheoryexamples.com/) and re-hosted it here.

My ultimate goal is to allow other users to add examples via the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/meganlavengood/musictheoryexamples). In the meantime, I am working on providing a stable reconstruction of the old site, with better accessibility and functionality.
